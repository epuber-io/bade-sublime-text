# Bade for Sublime Text

**!!! This is early stage of syntax definition of Bade for Sublime Text. Tested on Sublime Text 3. Must admit, that it is forked definition of Jade (they are very similar). !!!**

A **TextMate Bundle** for the **Bade** templating language. Implemented in
JSON-tmLanguage, a compiled tmLanguage version is included. All language
features that I know of (including some undocumented ones and quircks of the
Bade parser) and some indent increase/decrease patterns are implemented.

## Installation

### Sublime Text manual installation

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages
    git clone https://github.com/epuber-io/bade-sublime-text.git Bade

Patches for additions are always welcome.
